# Intro
**Here are four reasons why this tomato soup recipe will become your new favorite:**

This recipe offers classic homemade tomato soup flavor, and it’s made with basic pantry ingredients. Winning!
It’s rich and creamy, yet cream-less. It uses a combination of white beans (I promise you can’t taste them) and butter to achieve this feat.
This soup is special diet-friendly. It’s gluten free, since it doesn’t need any flour for thickening. It’s also easily made vegan—see the recipe notes.
You can turn this recipe into tomato basil soup, if you have fresh basil on hand. It couldn’t be easier.
